    <b>Submit:</b> Turn in your

    entire <code>xinu-hw9</code> directory source files

    using the <tt>turnin</tt> command
    on <tt>morbius.mscsnet.mu.edu</tt> or one of the other
    <a href="https://www.cs.mu.edu/~brylow/machine.txt">
      Systems Lab machines</a>.  Please run "<tt>make clean</tt>" in
      the
    <tt>compile/</tt> subdirectory just before submission to reduce
    unnecessary space consumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    Work should be completed <strong>in pairs.</strong>  Be certain
    to include both names in the comment block at the top of all
    source code files, with a <tt>TA-BOT:MAILTO</tt> comment line
    including any addresses that should automatically receive results.
    It would be courteous to confirm with your partner when submitting
    the assignment.
  </p>

<h2>Threads</h2>

<h3 class="takehome">Preparation</h3>

  <p>
    Make a fresh copy of your work thus far.
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> cp -R xinu-hw8 xinu-hw9</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, untar the new project files on top of it:
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>tar xvzf ~brylow/os/Projects/xinu-hw9.tgz</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
    Be certain to <tt>make clean</tt> before compiling for the first time.
  </p>

  <h3 class="takehome">Threads vs. Processes</h3>

  <p> The distinction between the concepts of "threads" and "processes"
  can be an important one. Our textbook provides the definition that
  processes execute in their own memory space, whereas threads share the
  same memory space within a process.  But beyond that, most of the aspects
  of processes we have already studied seem to repeat for threads -- you
  need a thread control block, each thread gets its own stack of activation
  records, we need to worry about a scheduling policy for deciding which
  thread we will context switch to next, etc. </p>

  <p> In truth, in the context of a simplified, embedded, educational operating
  system like ours, the distinction between processes and threads is not
  very relevant.  We could label it either way, and build out the system
  in more concrete ways to reinforce that interpretation.  In this assignment,
  we muddy the waters slightly further by implementing a crucial subset
  of the standard PThreads API using what the lightweight processes we've
  been working with all along. </p>

<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<p>In addition to the code changes below, there are a few minor changes needed to get this assignment running. The first change is a minor fix.  The second and third changes 
  are related to sharing a page table between child and parent processes.  Since children and parent processes share a page table, they can't all have the same virtual address
  for their process stack and swaparea.  Otherwise, they'd all overwrite each other!  Thus, we must give threads a unique virtual addresses for a virtual stack and swap area. 
  To do this, we take into account the PID (unique to each process and thread) when creating the virtual addresses for the thread stack and swap area. 
  To quickly access the PID in interrupt.S, we store the PID in the <tt>tp</tt> register.  We use the equation <code>[PROCSTACKADDR OR SWAPAREAADDR] - ((pid+1) * PAGE_SIZE)</code> to
  calculate the virtual address for the thread stack and swap area.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <tt>mapPage</tt> and <tt>mapAddress</tt> functions in map.c, change the <tt>attr</tt> parameter to a ulong.</li>
  <li>In create.c, set the <tt>tp</tt> register to the pid of the new process.  We will use the <tt>tp</tt> register to hold the current process ID.</li>
  <li>In ctxsw.S, restore the <tt>tp</tt> register.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="takehome">PThreads API</h3>

  <p> The new tarball provides an <tt>include/pthread.h</tt> header that
    defines the crucial <tt>#define</tt>s and function
    prototypes to mimic the standard POSIX PThreads interface.
    Chapter 27 in our textbook explains how this API works, and gives
    excellent examples. </p>

  <p> The mapping of these PThread functions to existing Embedded Xinu
    functions is the primary content of this assignment. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>pthread_create()</tt> creates a new thread, and returns its ID.
	We can accomplish the same work with our new <tt>ptcreate()</tt>
	function.  We'll define <tt>pthread_t</tt> as a PID, and ignore the
	<tt>pthread_attr_t</tt> type as a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer.  The
	mechanism for passing arguments to a pthread is more simplistic than
	our varadic argument <tt>create()</tt>
    </li>

    <li>
      <tt>pthread_join()</tt> is an important coordination function that
	we do not currently have an analog for, so we must build one.
	When process <i>A</i> calls <tt>pthread_join()</tt> on a process <i>B</i>,
	process <i>A</i> poll the PCB of process <i>B</i>'s state until its <i>PRFREE</i>.
	When process <i>B</i> terminates, process <i>A</i> should continue its execution. Since 
  <tt>pthread_join()</tt> does not need special kernel priveldges, it can be implemented
  completely in user land. Challenge/possible exam question, what could we do to improve this?
  Given the structures currently implemented in our operating system, what could we do to avoid the polling?
  <br />
    </li>
    <li> <tt> pthread_mutex_lock()</tt>, and </li> 
    <li> <tt> pthread_mutex_unlock()</tt>  can be implemented
      as a simple spinlock based on the atomic CAS operation now provided
      in <tt>lock.c</tt>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Last Call for System Calls</h2>
  <p>
    Each of the four PThread API functions above should be implemented as
    <i>system calls</i> by extending the trap handlers we built in
    <a href="Project5.html">Project 5: Trap Handlers</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add new entries to the global <tt>syscall_table</tt> in
    <tt>syscall_dispatch.c</tt>.  Note that the row in the table must
    correspond to the correct syscall numbers defined above.  The
    first column in the table is the number of arguments the syscall
    expects.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Repeat this process for our new PThreads interface:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>
#define SYSCALL_PTCREATE &nbsp;&nbsp; 13 /**< PThread create                   */ <br />
#define SYSCALL_PTLOCK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 /**< PThread mutex lock               */ <br />
#define SYSCALL_PTUNLOCK &nbsp;&nbsp; 16 /**< PThread mutex unlock             */
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>  
    When all is said and done, you should be able to compile and execute
    our <a href="pdemo3.c">lab demo PThread code</a> correctly on your
    Embedded Xinu kernel.
