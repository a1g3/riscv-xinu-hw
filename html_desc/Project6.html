  <h2>Project #6: Priority Scheduling and Preemption</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <p id="ProjectDeadline6"></p>
  
  <p> <b>Submit:</b> Turn in your
    entire <code>xinu-hw6</code> directory
    source files using the
    <tt>turnin</tt> command on <tt>morbius.mscsnet.mu.edu</tt> or
    one of the other
    <a href="https://www.cs.mu.edu/~brylow/machine.txt">
      Systems Lab machines</a>.  Please run "<tt>make clean</tt>" in the
    <tt>compile/</tt> subdirectory just before submission to reduce
  unnecessary space consumption.</p>

  <p>Work should be completed <strong>in pairs.</strong>  Be certain
    to include both names in the comment block at the top of all
    source code files, with a <tt>TA-BOT:MAILTO</tt> comment line including
    any addresses that should automatically receive results.
    It would be courteous to confirm with your
    partner when submitting the assignment.
    </p>

  
  <h2>Priority Scheduling</h2>

  <h3 class="takehome">Preparation</h3>

  <p> First, make a copy of your Project 5 directory:<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>cp -R xinu-hw5 xinu-hw6</tt><br />
    Then, untar the new project files on top of it:<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>tar xvzf ~brylow/os/Projects/xinu-hw6.tgz</tt>
  </p>
  <p> Be certain to <tt>make clean</tt> before compiling for the first time.</p>


<h3 class="takehome">Round-Robin Priority Scheduling</h3>

  <p>
    You will use three round-robin priority queues (one each for
    "low", "medium", and "high" priority) to add priority scheduling
    to your operating system.
  </p>

  <p> This priority scheduler can be implemented in four easy steps: </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Add a priority field called "<tt>priority</tt>" into the PCB structure
      defined in <tt>include/proc.h</tt>. </li>
    <li> Add priority parameter to <tt>create()</tt>, and properly
      initialize the priority field in each new PCB created.</li>
    <li> Modify the <tt>ready()</tt> and <tt>resched()</tt> functions
      to properly use the three priority queues. See corresponding
      TODO comments in <tt>ready.c</tt> and <tt>resched.c</tt> for
      details. </li>
	<li> Add the code specified below in the <code>dispatch()</code> function in <code>dispatch.c</code> </li>
  </ul>

  <p> New test cases are in <tt>system/testcases.c</tt>, which should
    demonstrate priority-order execution once your new scheduler is
    operational. You will need to create others to fully test your
    implementation.
  </p>
    
<h3 class="takehome">Starvation and Aging</h3>

<p>One of the chief drawbacks to simple priority scheduling is that
low priority processes may be <i>starved</i> by high priority
processes. That is, they may never get to run at all.  One remedy for
this it to implement <i>aging</i>, a scheme in which the effective
priority of a process increases the longer it sits in the ready list without
running.</p>

<p>We've added a kernel configuration parameter "<tt>AGING</tt>" into <tt>include/kernel.h</tt>.  
Add code into <tt>resched.c</tt> so that when <tt>AGING</tt>
is <tt>TRUE</tt>, available processes are moved, or "promoted", 
to a higher priority queue  
when certain time conditions are met (see TODOs in <tt>resched()</tt> and 
definitions in <tt>include/clock.h</tt>).
</p>

<p>Construct a test case that demonstrates process starvation when <tt>AGING</tt> is 
<tt>FALSE</tt>, but demonstrates aging when <tt>AGING</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>.
Put your aging test case in <tt>testcases.c</tt>, and make it run when the
input is 'A'.</p>

<h3 class="takehome">Preemption</h3>

<p> The new files <tt>system/clk*</tt> will provide you with basic
preemption, as discussed in class. Take time to familiarize yourself
with the contents of these files, as you will be responsible for
understanding how these components of the operating system work.</p>

<p> Activate preemption by changing the <tt>PREEMPT</tt> constant
in <tt>include/kernel.h</tt> to <tt>TRUE</tt>.

How can you test that preemption is working in your system? Create a
test case that demonstrates preemptive scheduling.  Put your
preemption test case in <tt>testcases.c</tt>, and make it run when the
input is 'P'.</p>

<h3 class="takehome">dispatch.c</h3>
The following lines (specifically the else statement) will need to be added to your <code>dispatch()</code> 
function in the <code>dispatch.c</code> file to handle interrupts.
<pre>
if((long)cause > 0) {
    cause = cause << 1;
    cause = cause >> 1;

    // ... Your dispatch code here ...
} else {
    cause = cause << 1;
    cause = cause >> 1;
    uint irq_num;

    volatile uint *int_sclaim = (volatile uint *)(PLIC_BASE + 0x201004);
    irq_num = *int_sclaim;

    if(cause == I_SUPERVISOR_EXTERNAL) {
        interrupt_handler_t handler = interruptVector[irq_num];

        *int_sclaim = irq_num;
        if (handler)
        {
            (*handler) ();
        } else {
            kprintf("ERROR: No handler registered for interrupt %u\r\n",
                    irq_num);

            while (1)
                ;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h3 class="takehome">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li> To submit your project, please run "<tt>make clean</tt>" in your
<tt>compile</tt> directory, change directory back two levels, and submit
the entire system with the command <tt>turnin xinu-hw6</tt>.  You can
verify what you have submitted using <tt>turnin -v</tt>.</li>

<li> To complete this assignment, you will have made changes to
several header files in the <tt>include/</tt> directory, and many .c files 
in the <tt>system/</tt> directory.</li>

</ul>
