</div>

<div>
  <p id="ProjectDeadline3"></p>
  
  <p> <b>Submit:</b> Turn in your
    <code>kprintf.c</code> and <code>testcases.c</code>
    source files using the
    <tt>turnin</tt> command on <tt>morbius.mscsnet.mu.edu</tt> or
    one of the other
    <a href="https://www.cs.mu.edu/~brylow/machine.txt">
      Systems Lab machines</a>.</p>

  <p>Work should be completed <strong>in pairs.</strong>  Be certain
    to include both names in the comment block at the top of all
    source code files. It would be courteous to confirm with your
    partner when submitting the assignment.  You may modify any files
    in the operating system, but only changes to "kprintf.c" will be
    graded for this assignment.</p>


<h2>Synchronous Serial Driver</h2>

<h3 class="takehome">Preparation</h3>

  <p> You will have to familiarize yourself with several common UNIX
    tools for this assignment.  The first of these is <b>tar</b>, a
    utility originally devised to create <b>t</b>ape <b>ar</b>chives
    for the purpose of backing files up onto computer tapes.</p>

  <p> While <tt>tar</tt> is still used to create tape backups of file
    systems, it has become far more common to use <tt>tar</tt> to
    group files and/or directories together into a single entity,
    typically called a &quot;tar-ball.&quot; (So common is the use
    of <tt>tar</tt> that it has been verbed in computer science
    terminology: We speak of &quot;tarring&quot; files, or files that
    have been &quot;tarred up.&quot;) <tt>Tar</tt> syntax is somewhat
    arcane, as <tt>tar</tt> came into existence before modern
    standards for command-line options.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Login to Morbius (or any of the
	other <a href="https://www.cs.mu.edu/~brylow/machine.txt">
	Systems Lab machines</a>
      and change to your working directory.</li>
    <li> Execute the the following command:<br />

	&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> tar xvzf ~brylow/os/Projects/xinu-hw3.tgz</tt>
      </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This untars the files into your working directory, in a subdirectory
    called <tt>xinu-hw3</tt>.</p>

  <p>For more information on <tt>tar</tt>, please see the UNIX man pages.</p>

  
<h3 class="takehome">Building</h3>

  <p>While the <tt>gcc</tt> command-line options provide a great deal
    of flexibility when compiling programs, things quickly become
    unmanageable when the number of source files exceeds what you can
    conveniently type in a few seconds.</p>

  <p> The <b>make</b> utility can be thought of as a companion to the
    compiler infrastructure (preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and
    linker) that allows the build rules for large projects to be
    explicitly encoded in <tt>Makefiles</tt>.  A <tt>Makefile</tt>
    typically consists of common definitions, (such as, which compiler
    to use), and a set of rules.  Each rule has a <i>target</i>, such
    as the file that is to be built, and can be followed by a list of
    dependencies and a sequence of steps to perform in order to build
    that target.  In addition, <tt>make</tt> has quite a few common
    rules built into it.</p>

  <p> You will not have to write your own <tt>Makefiles</tt> for this
    course, but you will have to use and possibly modify some for all
    of our remaining assignments.  The <tt>Makefile</tt> is always
    human-readable, so feel free to open them up and look
    around.</p>

  <p> To build the XINU operating system, perform the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Change directory into the top level produced by the tar-ball,
      called <tt>xinu-hw3</tt> for this assignment.</li>
  
    <li> Change directory into the subdirectory &quot;<tt>compile</tt>&quot;. 
      This directory contains the XINU project <tt>Makefile</tt>, and is where
      all of the compiled &quot;<tt>.o</tt>&quot; files will go.</li>
  
    <li> Execute the the following command:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>
	make clean </tt><br /> By standard convention, almost
	all <tt>Makefiles</tt> include a target called
	&quot;clean&quot; that removes everything except the source
	code.  The tar-ball you unpacked already should be clean, but
	it never hurts to make sure that you are starting from a clean
	slate.  You may find yourself using this command often.</li>
  <li> Execute the the following command:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt> make </tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This should produce about a page of output as each source file is
    compiled, and the resulting object files are linked together to
    form the operating system, a simple set of library functions, and
    the boot loader.  If all goes as it should, you should find the
    directory full of <tt>.o</tt> files from all of the source code in
    the other subdirectories, and most importantly, a newly compiled
    operating system image called &quot;<tt>xinu.boot</tt>.&quot;</p>

  <p>For more information on <tt>make</tt>, please see the UNIX man pages.</p>

  <p> Your XINU image is now ready to be run on a backend machine.  To
    transfer it there, we have a special utility
    called <b>riscv-console</b>.  Execute <tt>riscv-console</tt> in
    the <tt>compile</tt> directory where your
    <tt>xinu.boot</tt> file resides.  <tt>riscv-console</tt> will
    connect your terminal to the first available backend machine, and you
    should see a message like:<br />&nbsp;<br />

    &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>connection 'poodoo', class 'riscv', host 'morbius.mscs.mu.edu'</tt><br/>&nbsp;<br/>

    depending on which backend you get.  This will be immediately
    followed by a stream of automated commands as the embedded target
    system boots, configures its network settings, and uploads
    your <tt>xinu.boot</tt> kernel.</p>

  <p> The most important thing to remember about <tt>riscv-console</tt>
    is that it is <i>modal</i>, like <tt>vim</tt>.  You start out in
    direct connection mode, in which your terminal connects directly
    through special hardware to the serial console on your backend
    machine.  To get out of <tt>riscv-console</tt>, hit Control-Space,
    followed by the 'q' key. </p>

  <h3 class="takehome">Embedded XINU Source</h3>

  <p> The source tar-ball we are starting with contains only a few
    files for the operating system proper, in the
    subdirectory <tt>system</tt>.  We will be adding files into this
    directory in every subsequent assignment.</p>

  <p> The other files in the XINU subdirectories break down as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>compile/</tt> contains the compilation files for XINU.
    </li>
    <li> <tt>include/</tt> contains all of our local <tt>.h</tt>
      header files used throughout the rest of the source code files.
      At compile time, these are treated as being in a standard
      location, so they can be included with
      &quot;<tt>#include&lt;...&gt;</tt>&quot; rather than
      &quot;<tt>#include&quot;...&quot;</tt>&quot;.  The header file
      particularly important for this assignment
      is <tt>include/ns16550.h</tt>, which contains the structure and
      constants for the serial port hardware.
    </li>
    <li> <tt>lib/</tt> contains a small library of standard C functions we can
      rely upon in the operating system, like <tt>strncmp()</tt> and 
      <tt>atoi()</tt>, etc.  Remember -- the UNIX system libraries are
      not available to our operating system running on the backend!
    </li>
    <li> <tt>system/</tt> contains a file called <tt>start.S</tt>,
    XINU's boot loader for this platform, which sets up the multicore
    architecture and passes control to the operating system startup
    code in the file called <tt>initialize.c</tt>.
    </li>
    <li> At any time throughout this course, to achieve a solid
      understanding of what the OS is programmed to do, your are
      encouraged to navigate and observe XINU's boiler-plate files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="takehome">Synchronous Serial Driver</h3>

  <p> Your task for this assignment is to write a simple
    <i>synchronous serial driver</i> for the embedded operating
    system, so that you can see what you are doing in all subsequent
    assignments.</p>

  <p> The driver is "synchronous" because it waits for the slow I/O
    device to do its work, rather than using interrupts to communicate
    with the hardware.</p>

  <p> The driver is "serial" because it sends characters one at a time
    down an RS-232 serial port interface, like the one found on most
    modern PC's.</p>

  <p> The driver is a "driver" because it provides the software
    interface necessary for the operating system to communicate with
    the hardware which, in this case, is an I/O device.</p>

  <p> This platform's serial port, or UART (Universal Asynchronous
    Receiver / Transmitter) is a member of the venerable 16550 family
    of UARTs,
    documented <a href="https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/D1/D1_User_Manual_V0.1_Draft_Version.pdf">here</a>. Of
    particular interest to us is section 9.2.5 of the specification,
    which describes the registers accessible to programmers. On this
    platform (the Sipeed Nezha), the UART control and status
    registers are memory-mapped, starting with base address
    0x2500000. You can view these address definitions
    in <tt>include/ns16550.h</tt></p>

  <p> The file <tt>system/kprintf.c</tt> has the skeleton code for
    four I/O-related functions: <tt>kputc()</tt>, (puts a single
    character to the serial port,) <tt>kgetc()</tt>, (gets a single
    character from the serial port,) <tt>kungetc()</tt>, (puts "back"
    a single character, ala K&R's <tt>getch()</tt>
    and <tt>ungetch()</tt> functions,) and <tt>kcheckc()</tt> (checks
    whether a character is available.)  Each function contains a
    "TODO" comment where you should add code.  The
    actual <tt>kprintf()</tt> is already complete; it will begin
    working as soon as you complete the <tt>kputc()</tt> function upon
    which it relies.</p>
