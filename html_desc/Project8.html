  <h2>Project #8: Heap Memory</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <p id="ProjectDeadline8"></p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Submit:</b> Turn in your

    entire <code>xinu-hw8</code> directory source files

    using the <tt>turnin</tt> command
    on <tt>morbius.mscsnet.mu.edu</tt> or one of the other
    <a href="https://www.cs.mu.edu/~brylow/machine.txt">
      Systems Lab machines</a>.  Please run "<tt>make clean</tt>" in
      the
    <tt>compile/</tt> subdirectory just before submission to reduce
    unnecessary space consumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    Work should be completed <strong>in pairs.</strong>  Be certain
    to include both names in the comment block at the top of all
    source code files, with a <tt>TA-BOT:MAILTO</tt> comment line
    including any addresses that should automatically receive results.
    It would be courteous to confirm with your partner when submitting
    the assignment.
  </p>

<h2>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>

<h3 class="takehome">Preparation</h3>

  <p>
    First, make a fresh copy of your work thus far.
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> cp -R xinu-hw7 xinu-hw8</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, untar the new project files on top of it:
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>tar xvzf ~brylow/os/Projects/xinu-hw8.tgz</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
    Be certain to <tt>make clean</tt> before compiling for the first time.
  </p>


<h3 class="takehome">Fixing a bug in create.c</h3>

  <p>
    As some of you may have seen, sometimes your OS will crash
    when it gets to the null process.  If you wrote more elaborate 
    testcases last assignment that called <code>user_yield</code>,
    the same error will occur. This was due to user processes sharing the 
    same kernel stack.  Since they are sharing the same kernel stack,
    if one process yields, then the next process will overwrite any contents
    the first process stored on it's kernel stack.  Once the first process runs again,
    all it's kernel variables will be overwritten!  This is very bad!  There's
    a simple one line fix to address this issue, when setting the <code>PREG_KERNSP</code>,
    instead of setting it to <code>_kernsp</code>, we need to set it to <code>(ulong)pgalloc() + PAGE_SIZE</code>
    This change will allow all proccess to get their own kernel stack, so they're not overwriting each other.
    To learn more about stack and how compilers use them, take COSC 4400: Compilers in Fall 2024 
    (or COSC 3410: Programming Languages next semester) with Dr. Brylow!
  </p>

<h3 class="takehome">Getmem and Freemem</h3>

  <p>
    The files <tt>include/memory.h</tt>
    and <tt>system/vm_userinit.c</tt> define and initialize a free
    lists of available memory blocks on the heap.
    Implement <tt>system/getmem.c</tt>
    and <tt>system/freemem.c</tt> to dole out blocks of requested
    memory and properly maintain the free list.  Use First Fit with
    simple compaction.  (Compaction is the "stretch" problem in this
    assignment -- get everything else working first.)
  </p>

<h3 class="takehome">Malloc and Free</h3>

  <p>
    Your <tt>getmem()</tt> and <tt>freemem()</tt> functions assume
    that the programmer independently tracks the size of an allocated
    block, and passes that size as the second parameter
    to <tt>freemem()</tt>.  Most operating systems APIs assume that
    having the pointer to the beginning of the block is enough to free
    it.  This can be accomplished through the use of accounting
    information, often hidden adjacent to the memory block itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implement <tt>malloc()</tt> and <tt>free()</tt> to work as
    wrappers around <tt>getmem()</tt> and <tt>freemem()</tt> to
    provide this API.  The <tt>malloc()</tt> function should pad the
    request size to include an accounting block before
    calling <tt>getmem()</tt>, and stores the accounting information
    after the allocation.  The <tt>free()</tt> function recovers the
    accounting information to provide the size to <tt>freemem()</tt>.
  </p>

<h3 class="takehome">Grading</h3>

  <p>
    Project credit will be divvied up evenly between getting memory,
    freeing memory, compaction, and <tt>getstk()</tt> removal.  By
    now, you should be aware that rigorous testing is the key to
    success in these projects.  Our test cases will include at least:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Verifying that your <tt>getmem()</tt> and <tt>freemem()</tt>
      functions operate correctly over a variety of request sizes;
    </li>
  
    <li>
      Checking your memory free list under a wide variety of
      conditions; if you are not writing a helper function to print
      out your free list, you are probably not serious about
      understanding what your system is doing;
    </li>
  
    <li>
      Allocating and freeing as much memory as possible, (How can you
      tell whether you have a memory leak?); and
    </li>
  
    <li>
      Verifying that your <tt>freemem()</tt> compaction works.
    </li>
  </ul>
