  <h2>It's a Trap!</h2>

  <h3 class="takehome">Preparation</h3>

  <p>
  First, make a copy of your Project 4 directory:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>cp -R
  xinu-hw4 xinu-hw5</tt><br> Then, untar the new project files on top of
  it:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>tar xvzf ~brylow/os/Projects/xinu-hw5.tgz</tt>
  </p>

<p> New files:

   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><tt>system/start.S</tt></td>

</p>

<p>
  The <tt>dispatch()</tt> currently function defaults to treating the <code>ecall</code>
  (environment call) instruction as a generic, show-stopping hardware
  exception.  You must add the intelligence to recognize when the exception
  is caused by a deliberate System Call from a "user" process in to the
  "kernel", and collect the system state information necessary for
  <tt>syscall_dispatch()</tt> to do its work.
</p>

<p>
  To begin, we'll start with just five simple syscalls:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>user_none()</code> - A dummy syscall that goes to the O/S kernel,
    does nothing, and comes back.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>user_yield()</code> - Allows the current running process to yield the
    processor, inviting the O/S to reschedule another process to run, if
    conditions permit.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code> user_getc()</code> - Fetches a character from a hardware input
    device.  By default, device '0' will be your existing synchronous serial
    port driver.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code> user_putc()</code> - Writes a character to a hardware output device.
    By default, device '0' will be your existing synchronous serial port
    driver.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code> user_kill()</code> - Kills the current running process
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
   It's important to understand the various privilege levels a RISC-V
   processor can be in. Different privilege levels dictate which
   control and status registers can be accessed.  RISC-V has three different
   privilege levels (listed from highest to lowest privilege).
   <ol>
      <li>Machine mode (M-Mode) - Allows unfettered access to all control and status level registers.  Any program running in M-Mode has virtually no restrictions.  On our RISC-V boards, only U-Boot runs in M-Mode.</li>
      <li>Supervisor mode (S-Mode) - Allows the program to modify any supervisor-level control and status registers.  S-Mode is designed for running a kernel. In our implementation, only the main processes will run in S-Mode.  All other processes will run in U-Mode.</li>
      <li>User mode (U-Mode) - A process running here cannot modify any of the hardware or the control and status registers. It must execute a system call so a higher privilege mode can do that action on its behalf.</li>
   </ol>
   A process cannot simply change it's own privilege level.  That would circumvent security completely!  Instead it must make a system call using the <code>ecall</code> instruction.  Once an <code>ecall</code> instruction is executed, the processor automatically elevates to the next higher
   privilege level and runs that privilege's trap handler.  Once that mode is done servicing the trap, it executes an <code>mret</code> or <code>sret</code> (depending on the mode) instruction to return to the privilege mode it was previously in and continue where it left off.
</p>

<p>
	Once you believe your've finished your trap handler, you will need to make modifications to <code>ctxsw.S</code>
	and <code>create.c</code> files.  In <code>ctxsw.S</code>, you need remove the <code>jalr</code> line and replace it with
	<pre>
	ld t0, PREG_PC*8(**REGISTER THAT HOLDS newregs ADDRESS**)
	beq t0, ra, switch
	li t4, SSTATUS_S_MODE
	csrc sstatus, t4
	csrw sepc, t0

	sret
switch:
	ret
	</pre>
	This section of code switches from S-Mode to U-Mode if the process is running the first time.  All other times, the process
	must have got to ctxsw from a trap, thus we will let the trap handler switch modes when it returns.

	Since <code>kill()</code> is a kernel mode function (which should not be directly called by user processes), you must change the <code>kill(currpid);</code> line in <code>create.c</code> to <code>user_kill();</code>  
 </p>

<p>
   Our current simple embedded O/S does not yet provide <i>memory
   protection</i>.  As a result, our system call interface
   will only provide the first of required components for protecting the
   O/S from user processes.  Your user processes will still be able to call
   <b>most</b> arbitrary internal kernel functions without going through the system call
   interface, and read or write data from other processes or the O/S itself. Since
   <code>ctxsw</code> has a special instruction (<code>sret</code>) that can only be run from S-Mode,
   only processes running in S-Mode (like the init process) can run ctxsw.  If you
   get an Illegal Instruction exception, that means you're calling functions from
   a mode that you don't have the privilege to call.
</p>

<p>
   As we add more features to our O/S in weeks to come, we will create the
   memory virtualization abstractions that will prevent user code from
   accessing O/S functions and data without going through an approved
   <code>user_*</code> system call function.  For now, we're building system
   calls even though all of our processes are still executing at the "kernel"
   privilege level, with unrestricted view of all memory.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="takehome">Testing</h3>

<p>
  The default test cases provided with the tarball exercise each one of our
  starting system calls at least once.  Judicious use of additional debugging
  <code>kprintf()</code> calls will be essential for debugging your system
  call interface as you build it.  Be certain to comment out these debugging
  statements when you turn in your code each night, lest TA-Bot find your
  code unworthy.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have the basics working, consider filling in some of the other
  system call stubs left for future expansion, or write a version of
  <code>user_printf()</code> that processes all of the format string in
  the user process, but relies on the <code>user_putc()</code> syscall for
  requesting that the O/S output each resulting character.
</p>

<p>
  This project can be completed in fewer than a dozen lines of code, but
  the technical details of the system call can be quite complex and
  hard to keep straight.  It is very unlikely that random code snippets from
  the Internet will help to solve this one -- it is essential that you
  understand the data structures and mechanisms involved, and reason through
  an adequate design to solve the problem.
